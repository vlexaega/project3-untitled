### Vite PWA:

- The Vite PWA documentation was very helpful to understand how to configure our page into a progressive web app. Here is a link for the webpage: https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/.
- I used the tutorial 'Coding Shorts: Using the Vite PWA Plug-in' by Shawn Wildermuth to get started with the process, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSGLw4T8BgQ.
- I learned about favicons from an article titled 'What Is a Favicon, Why Is It Important, and How Do I Add One?' by Jay Kang, available here: https://www.seoptimer.com/blog/what-is-a-favicon/.
- The following site helped me convert an image into a favicon with all the necessary files: https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/.
- I was able to make an image with a transparent background through Adobe Express: https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/transparent-background.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

- Artist can easily share their work through creating their own personal profile / signing up.
- Artists have the ability to upload their work and sell it.
- Artists can recieve feedback within the form of "comments" per each piece of art.
- Artist has the ability to have comment section disabled if they choose.


## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
