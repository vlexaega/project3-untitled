# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

### Vite PWA:

The Vite PWA documentation was very helpful to understand how to configure our page into a progressive web app. Here is a link for the webpage: https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/.

I used the tutorial 'Coding Shorts: Using the Vite PWA Plug-in' by Shawn Wildermuth to get started with the process, available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSGLw4T8BgQ.

I learned about favicons from an article titled 'What Is a Favicon, Why Is It Important, and How Do I Add One?' by Jay Kang, available here: https://www.seoptimer.com/blog/what-is-a-favicon/.

The following site helped me convert an image into a favicon with all the necessary files: https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/.

I was able to make an image with a transparent background through Adobe Express: https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/transparent-background.

### Selected Medium
I consulted this Medium article to select the user's medium choice from a dropdown menu: https://medium.com/@samleashrauner/add-to-a-database-with-selectedindex-6311354b0082

The template for the dropdown menu comes from the Tailwind CSS docs, available here: https://tailwind-elements.com/docs/standard/forms/select/

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
Tailwind Elements:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/tw-elements

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

Thank you to the following tutorials which helped with our project:

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

---

The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
